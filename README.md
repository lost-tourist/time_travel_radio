# thing_player
An MP3 player built around a Sparkfun Thing Plus board

# Time Machine radio

Although this code could be readily adapted to be a general mp3 player,
that isn't the primary purpose either of the code or of the electronics
project it is designed for.

Instead, this is a device intended purely to play music from the 1980s.

Upon power-up, a random year between 1980 and 1989 will be selected. After
a brief display of which specific year is being played, mp3 files from that
year will be continually played, at random.

The user has the ability to pause the current track, and to select "play the
following year" / "play the previous year", at which point the current
playlist will be terminated and a new one begun on the selected year.

The general aim is for this to be installed inside a vintage radio case
(or at least something that looks like it could be a vintage radio).

# TODO

The code works, however I'm still learning Fritzing so I can't yet provide
a full schematic or diagram of the components involved.
